***Assignment 1:***

Note: Add the assignment to the GitHub classroom by creating a folder Assignment1.

1. Create a Dockerfile that uses the official Node.js image (`node:18-slim`) to run a JavaScript file called `hello.js`, which prints `Hello, Docker World!` to the console. On a Readme file, write the steps to build the Docker image, run the container, list the image, list the container and see the output message. Add a screenshot of the output. (Hint: use `COPY` instruction in Dockerfile)




2. Write a `docker-compose.yml` file to run two containers using the same image created above, ensuring that they can run independently. On a Readme file, include the steps to use Docker Compose to bring up the containers and verify their outputs by showing the output message from both the containers. Add a screenshot of the output from both containers.
